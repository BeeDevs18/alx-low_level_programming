# C - Functions_nested_loops :page_with_curl: 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
## About this project:
In this project I continued learning and practicing;
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
- What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`
## Tasks file description;
  * [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
  * [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c): C function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns
  `1` if the character is uppercase, `0` otherwise.

  * [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c): C function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).
  Returns `1` if the character is a digit, `0` otherwise.

  * [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c): C function that multiplies two integers. Returns the value of
  the multiplication.

  * [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers `0` to
  `9`, followed by a new line.

  * [4-print_most_numbers](./4-print_most_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers
  `0` to `9` except for `2` and `4`, followed by a new line.

  * [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers `0` to
  `14`, followed by a new line, ten times.

  * [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c): C function that draws a straight line in the terminal
  using the character `_`, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

  * [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c): C function that draws a diagonal
  line in the terminal using the `\` character, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

  * [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c): C function that prints a square using the `#`
  character, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

  * [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c): C program that prints the numbers from `1` to
  `100`, but for multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number, for
  multiples of five, `Buzz`, and for multiples of both three and five, `FizzBuzz`.
    * Each number or word is separated by a space.

  * [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c): C function that prints a triangle using
  the `#` character, followed by a new line.
    * If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.
    
  * [100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c): C program that prints the largest prime factor
  of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

  * [101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c): C function that prints an integer without
  using `long`, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.
